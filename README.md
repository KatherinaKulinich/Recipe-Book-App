<h3>💬 Description </h3>

<p>
  This app is a comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that allows users to get recipes in 4 ways, browse them, and create and manage their own collection of recipes.
</p>
<p>
  The "Recipe Book App" offers a vast collection of mouthwatering recipes from all corners of the world. It provides an extensive array of recipes, including popular dishes, user favorites, and even a space to create and manage your very own recipes. 
</p>
<p>
  The app utilizes the <a href='https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/tasty'>TastyAPI</a> to fetch and present the wide array of recipes.
</p>

<h6>I imagined my mother when I was creating this app 💛</h6>
<p>
  The "Recipe Book App" is a true lifesaver for passionate home cooks like my mom who may have a chaotic collection of cherished recipes. With the ability to store all her favorite recipes in one place, she can bid farewell to the days of hunting through browser bookmarks, sifting through books, and searching for handwritten notes. Now, users like her can effortlessly save recipes they love, as well as her cherished handwritten recipes, all within the app. The app streamlines their culinary process, for organizing and experimenting with their treasured dishes in one convenient location. 
</p>
<p>(So this app could have been for my mom but she is still not good with computers 😅)</p>

<p>On the "Favorites" page, the user will find a list of recipes they've marked as favorites.</p>

<h6>❤️ Adding a Recipe to Favorites:</h6>
<p>Each recipe card within the app features a special flag under the recipe's photo. When a recipe is not in the user's list of favorites, this flag is displayed in a transparent state.

When a user taps the flag under a recipe that is already in their favorites on any page except the page with favorites recipes, the app displays a message indicating that the recipe has been added to favorites before.</p>

</div>


<h6>✏️ Editing a Recipe:</h6>
<p>Each of the user's own recipes is presented in a card format. At the bottom of the card, there is an "EDIT" button.
When the user clicks the "EDIT" button, a popup with editing form appears, displaying the existing data for the recipe.
Users have the ability to change the recipe's details, such as the recipe description, ingredients and cooking steps.
After making the desired edits, users can choose to resave the recipe with the updated information.</p>
<div align='center'>
  <img width='300' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/2e548d83-0f95-4086-9821-21dc366365fe'/>
</div>


<h6>❌ Deleting a Recipe:</h6>
<p>Near to the "EDIT" button on the recipe card, there is a "DELETE" button.
If a user decides to delete a recipe, clicking the "DELETE" button triggers a confirmation message to ensure that the user intends to delete the recipe.</p>
<div align='center'>
  <img width='200' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/6fc70d89-8a7e-4c99-8e92-18274efa157d'/>
</div>

<h4> 🍎 The filtering feature </h4>
<p>The app provides a user-friendly filtering feature that allows users to refine their recipe searches.</p>

<p>🔹 On every page that displays recipes, users can easily access the filter feature through a round button with a filter icon.
The filter feature offers three primary sorting options to cater to user preferences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From latest recipes to old</li>
  <li>From oldest to new</li>
  <li>From high rated to less rated</li>
</ul>
<div align='center'>
  <img width='200' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/74972c95-a2bc-4023-8c4b-0fe3213a76e4'/>
</div>

<p>🔹 On the "My Recipes" page, in addition to the universal sorting options, users can filter their own recipes based on categories. This empowers them to categorize and organize their personal recipes.</p>
<div align='center'>
  <img width='300' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/82962ac1-a9fe-4e8a-8cbf-d08946e9c731'/>
</div>


<h4> 🍎 The pagination </h4>
<p>Pagination is a feature that enhances the user's ability to navigate through the collection of recipes efficiently.</p>

<div align='center'>
  <img width='200' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/2048399b-3db6-4c45-98f4-faba68b22467'/>
</div>

<h6>❕❕❕Variable Number of Recipes on the pages</h6>
<p>The app dynamically retrieves recipes from the server, and the number of recipes received can vary due to server responses.
Some objects returned from the API contain individual recipe data, while others may include an arbitrary set of recipes. This behavior is a result of server-side operations and may lead to an inconsistent number of recipes on each page.</p>



<h4> 🍎 The theme </h4>
<p>Users have the option to switch between a light and dark theme, allowing them to tailor the app's appearance to their preferences and needs. </p>
<div align='center'>
  <img width='350' src='https://github.com/KatherinaKulinich/Recipe-Book-App/assets/109860560/1da89d15-0a63-4ba8-82b6-51f9afd12c2e'/>
